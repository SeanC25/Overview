<p> </p>
<p><strong>7 Your rights</strong></p>
<p>7.1 You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we hold about you; provision of such information
    will be subject to:</p>
<p>(a) the payment of a fee (currently fixed at GBP 240); and</p>
<p>(b) the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity (for this purpose, we will usually accept an original copy of
    a utility bill showing your current address).</p>
<p>7.2 We may withhold personal information that you request to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>7.3 You may instruct us at any time not to process your personal information for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>7.4 In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to our use of your personal information for
    marketing purposes, or we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of the use of your personal information
    for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>7.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those
    circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were
    collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing
    under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the
    personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general
    exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
    for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
<p>7.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances
    are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need
    the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise
    or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where
    processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only
    otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the
    protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.</p>
<p>7.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular
    situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for:
    the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in
    us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we
    will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
    processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise
    or defence of legal claims.</p>
<p>7.8 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including
    profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data
    for this purpose.</p>
<p>7.9 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research
    purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is
    necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</p>
<p>7.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:</p>
<p>(a) consent; or</p>
<p>(b) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take
    steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you
    have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
    However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<p>7.11 If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a
    legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the
    EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
<p>7.12 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the
    right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the
    withdrawal.</p>
<p>7.13 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.</p>
